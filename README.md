# OGC Geopackage Test Suite 1.0

## Overview
This OGCÂ® Encoding Standard defines GeoPackages for exchange and GeoPackage SQLite Extensions for
direct use of vector geospatial features and / or tile matrix sets of earth images and raster maps at 
various scales. Direct use means the ability to access and update data in a "native" storage format
without intermediate format translations in an environment (e.g. through an API) that guarantees data
model and data set integrity and identical access and update results in response to identical requests 
from different client applications. GeoPackages are interoperable across all enterprise and personal 
computing environments, and are particularly useful on mobile devices like cell phones and tablets in 
communications environments with limited connectivity and bandwidth.
